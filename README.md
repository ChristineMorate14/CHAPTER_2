# CHAPTER_2
#Creating a Hello World App
In this chapter, "Creating a hello world app" I learned how to create your first app and use hot reload to view changes instantaneously. I also learned how to use themes to style apps, when to use stateless and stateful widgets, and how to add external packages to save yourself from reinventing the wheel. I now have a general understanding of the main ideas behind Flutter app development. Creating a "Hello World" app in Flutter involves several steps. First, install the Flutter SDK and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Android Studio or Visual Studio Code. Then, create a new Flutter project using the command "flutter create hello_world" or through the IDE. Replace the existing code in main.dart with the basic Flutter app template, including the MaterialApp widget and a Scaffold with a text widget displaying "Hello, World!". Finally, run the app using "flutter run" or the IDE's run button, selecting a simulator or physical device as the target. This results in a simple app displaying "Hello, World!" on the screen, demonstrating the foundational structure of a Flutter application.
